 * runs an initialization script at document-start on every top-level navigation
 * this window makes, and this window goes a good deal further afield than Chat.
 * So the sections below only define their half of the app. The boot block at
 * the end is what decides how much of it the document in front of us has any
 * business receiving.
 *
 * No bundler and no build step: what is written here is what runs, so it has to
 * be what every supported webview already understands. The floors are WebKitGTK
 * on Ubuntu 24.04, WKWebView on macOS 15 (Safari 18) and evergreen WebView2, so
 * anything through ES2020 -- including `?.` and `??` -- is safe. The code below
 * predates the macOS 15 floor and mostly sticks to ES2015-2018; that is habit,
