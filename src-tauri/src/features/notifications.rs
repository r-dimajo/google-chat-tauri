//! Desktop notifications.
//!
//! Electron got these for free: Chromium implements the Web Notification API,
//! so `src/preload/overrideNotifications.ts` only had to wrap `window.Notification`
//! to hook the click. None of the three system webviews can do that:
//!
//! * **Linux (WebKitGTK)** -- the API exists, but permission is denied unless the
//!   embedder handles `WebKitWebView::permission-request`, and Tauri 2.11 exposes
//!   no way to do so (`WebviewBuilder::on_permission_request` is on `dev` only).
//!   Measured on this machine: `Notification.requestPermission()` -> `"denied"`.
//! * **macOS (WKWebView)** -- `window.Notification` does not exist at all.
//! * **Windows (WebView2)** -- the host must handle `NotificationReceived`, and
//!   wry does not, so notifications are silently dropped.
//!
//! So `chat.js` replaces `window.Notification` wholesale with a shim that reports
//! `"granted"` and forwards to this module. Chat only ever asks the shim, which
//! sidesteps the permission problem entirely.
//!
//! Clicking is where the platforms diverge. On Linux we get a real activation
//! callback and emit [`ACTIVATED_EVENT`]; `chat.js` then dispatches a synthetic
//! `click` on the original `Notification` object, so Google's own handler runs
//! and opens the conversation -- more than the electron original did, which only
//! raised the window. macOS and Windows have no equivalent hook here.
