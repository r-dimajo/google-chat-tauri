# Workarounds

Code in this repo that looks wrong, redundant or over-complicated until you know what it is working around. Each entry
below is one deliberate deviation from the obvious implementation. **Read the entry before changing the code it names**
— the obvious simplification has usually been tried already.

The measurements and platform behaviour behind these are in [Notes.md](Notes.md).

## The page

### Link policy lives in `chat.js`, not in `on_navigation`

`on_navigation` looks like the natural place for a host allow-list, and it is the wrong one: wry's WebKitGTK backend
fires it for every frame, so an allow-list there rejects legitimate third-party iframes. The injected script runs in the
main frame only, which is exactly the granularity the policy needs.

### `chat.js` installs three different amounts of itself

An initialization script is attached to the webview, not to a page: Tauri runs it at document-start on every top-level
navigation, and this window goes well beyond Chat — a country sign-in domain, an employer's identity provider while the
link grant is open, a marketing page after a sign out, the webview's own failed-load document. So the boot block at the
end of the file branches on `location.origin`, which is the same thing Tauri's ACL keys on:

| where | what runs |
|---|---|
| `mail.google.com`, `chat.google.com` | all of it |
| no origin at all (`"null"`) | the failed-load page rewrite, and nothing else |
| anywhere else | link hand-off, and nothing else |

Off Chat the bridge refuses every call, so the shortcuts would be swallowed and then refused, the notification shim
would promise a permission it cannot honour, and the poller would scrape a page with no unread count in it. None of that
is a security boundary — the ACL is, and it holds regardless — it is about not rearranging pages the app does not own.
Third-party sign-in is the case that made it matter: an identity provider's own click handler is where the sign-in
happens, and the interceptor used to call `stopPropagation()` on it.

### `handOff` navigates the window itself when `invoke` is refused

Link hand-off is the one thing that still runs off Chat, and only for a link that asks for a second window — `_blank`,
or `window.open`. wry has no handler to give it one, so without this nothing happens at all and the link looks dead;
worst case, signed out on a Google marketing page where "Sign in" is the only way back. The ACL refuses the hand-off on
those origins, so `handOff` falls back to navigating this window. Nothing is given up by it: the allow-list exists to
keep links shared *inside Chat* out of this window, and off the Chat origins there are none.

An ordinary cross-origin link is *not* taken off those pages. The page can follow it perfectly well by itself, and
taking it costs the page its own click handler for nothing.

### `urls::is_accounts_host` accepts country domains

Sign-in hops through `accounts.google.co.in/SetSID` and its equivalents. Treat one of those as an external link and the
system browser finishes the login instead of the app.

### `features::user_agent` spoofs Firefox

Google serves a degraded experience to browsers it does not recognise, and `accounts.google.com` is actively hostile to
them; WebKitGTK identifies as Safari on Linux. `GOOGLE_CHAT_UA` overrides the spoof without a rebuild, which is the
first thing to reach for when sign-in misbehaves.

### The has-unread flag comes from the favicon, not the DOM

Chat does not render its navigation while the window is hidden, so the elements the unread count scrapes are simply
absent and the count reads zero — precisely when the tray is the only thing the user can see. The favicon is driven by
data rather than layout, and Google publishes matching `..._no_dot_` and `..._dot_` variants to swap between.

That is also why the poller **must not be gated on page visibility**, which is the first thing it looks like it wants:
a `querySelector` every second, most of them while nobody is looking at the window. But hidden is exactly when the
favicon read is the only signal still working, and it is what keeps the tray icon honest. Gating on `document.hidden`
would either switch the poll off in the one state it matters in, or — if the webview does not report a tray-hidden
window as hidden — save nothing at all. Neither is worth having.

### `withGlobalTauri` stays on

It hands the remote page the whole `@tauri-apps/api` bundle as `window.__TAURI__`, which reads like a surface worth
closing. It is not, and turning it off would cost a feature.

Nothing in that bundle bypasses the ACL: every call still arrives as an `invoke` and is refused unless the capability
names it. What the capability names is the five commands in `chat-ipc` plus `event` listen/unlisten, and the only event
this app ever emits is `notification-activated`, whose payload is a notification id. So the bundle's presence adds no
reach the page did not already have — it only saves the page from spelling the calls out itself.

`chat.js` gets its `invoke` either way, falling back to `__TAURI_INTERNALS__`. The one hard dependency is
`__TAURI__.event.listen` in `listenForActivation`, which is what makes a notification click reach the page at all —
the reason Linux talks to `notify-rust` directly in the first place. Replacing it would mean driving
`plugin:event|listen` through `__TAURI_INTERNALS__` by hand, trading a documented API for an undocumented one, to close
something that is not open.

### Everything in `chat.js` must be idempotent

It is injected twice: once at document start, and again from `on_page_load` as a fallback. Anything that appends,
increments or registers unconditionally will do so twice.

### `chat.js` pastes a second time (Linux only)

WebKitGTK leaves files out of the paste event — `clipboardData` carries strings only (see Notes.md for both
measurements) — so Chat, which reads a pasted *file* from the event and nowhere else, does nothing on Ctrl+V.
`chat.js` therefore dispatches a second paste event with the files in hand: fetched through `clipboard_file` when the
event carries a `text/uri-list` (a file-manager copy), or read from `navigator.clipboard.read()` when it carries no
types at all (a copied image, the X11 shape). Chat takes the replay although it is untrusted. The replay only fires
for those two shapes: text and `text/html` pastes are Chat's to handle, and replaying over them would double them.

`clipboard_file` is the one command that hands the page file contents, and it is bounded rather than trusted: the ACL
limits it to the Chat origins, and the handler re-checks the page the window is showing, refuses any URI that is not
currently on the system clipboard's own uri-list (so a made-up path reads nothing), caps each file at 100 MB and the
clipboard at 16 files, and logs every refusal. What the page can reach is exactly what the user last copied — the
same thing a Ctrl+V reaches in any browser.

The drag half needs no code here: Tauri installs its own GTK drag controller by default, which eats the drop before
WebKit can turn it into a DOM event, so the builder calls `disable_drag_drop_handler()`. This app listens to none of
Tauri's DnD events, so nothing is given up. Kept off macOS — there, neither the paste nor the drop is known to drop
anything, and WKWebView answers a page-side clipboard read with a "Paste" callout of its own.

### `features::media` answers WebKit's permission requests itself (Linux only)

Tauri connects nothing to `WebKitWebView::permission-request`, and an unanswered request is refused — so every
`getUserMedia` failed at once with `NotAllowedError`. The handler allows the camera, the mic and device labels, only
while the window is on Chat itself (`urls::is_chat_page`, narrower than the link allow-list, which also trusts the
sign-in hosts). Everything else — notifications included — goes back to WebKit and is refused as before. It checks the
page the window shows, not the frame asking, because WebKitGTK does not say which frame that is.

## Notifications

### `window.Notification` is replaced wholesale, and Linux talks to `notify-rust` directly

The web API is unusable in all three webviews, so there is nothing to fall back to. Linux bypasses Tauri's notification
plugin as well, because that plugin's click API is mobile-only and a click is the whole point here.

### Notifications are delivered on one long-lived worker thread

`show_notification` is a synchronous Tauri command and Tauri runs those on the main thread — which on Linux is also the
thread drawing the window's own titlebar buttons. `notify_rust`'s `show()` round-trip costs up to 520 ms, so every
notification used to stall those buttons for that long and a burst compounded it. `features::notifications::show_linux`
hands the work to `deliver` on a worker instead.

It is deliberately *one* worker rather than a thread per notification: a burst then neither spawns threads unboundedly
nor lets popups reach the daemon out of order, which serialising on the main thread used to give for free.

### Only sixteen notifications may be waiting on a click

Each one holds a blocked thread and a D-Bus connection until it is clicked, dismissed or expires, so the cost tracks
what is undismissed on the desktop rather than what was delivered — see Notes.md for the measurement. Past
`MAX_WAITERS` a notification is still shown, it just carries no action. That is a cheap thing to lose here: a click on
Linux only raises the window, because Chat gives us nothing to navigate to. The cap is on *concurrent* waiters, so
slots come back as the user works through the tray — a burst of 60 still gave 48 of them click-through.

### Every notification names its desktop entry and asks for silence

`deliver` sends `desktop-entry: "Google Chat"` and `suppress-sound`. The first unlocks per-app settings (System Settings
→ Notifications) and must keep matching the installed desktop file's name, which Tauri derives from `productName` — the
same coupling the badge relies on. The second exists because the page plays its own sound and a daemon sound on top
delivered two notes per message.

### The click-waiter thread is named explicitly

Linux gives a new thread the creating thread's name, so the waiter spawned from the worker would inherit
`notifications` and the process would show two threads by that name — only one of them the worker. That is confusing at
exactly the moment you are reading a thread list to explain a freeze.

### `notifications::activated` raises the window, pauses, then tells the page

A hidden window is inert, not merely invisible: Chat's router does nothing until the page has painted. The ordering and
the pause are both load-bearing.

### A notification click raises the window and stops there

Chat's notifications carry no click handler that the page can reach, and there is no per-conversation URL to navigate to
instead — both properties of Chat rather than gaps in this app. `chat.js` still falls back to any Chat link in the
payload, and logs what each notification carries at `debug` so the next person can check whether that has changed.

### `GOOGLE_CHAT_NOTIFICATION_ACTIONS=0` exists

If a desktop's notification service invoked the `default` action on expiry rather than on a click, the window would rise
by itself after every message. The switch is there to prove or disprove that on a suspect desktop without a rebuild.

## Keyboard and menus

### `features::accelerators` asks WebView2 for Ctrl+W and Ctrl+Q directly (Windows only)

Menu accelerators never reach tao's message loop on Windows, so the accelerator text next to those two items was
decoration. Page-side forwarding cannot serve them either: forwarding only works on an origin the capability names, so
Ctrl+W died on the sign-in page, and `menu_action` refuses `quit` from the page on purpose. Taking the keys before the
page — `AcceleratorKeyPressed` on the controller Tauri hands out — fixes both and widens the IPC surface by nothing.

### `chat.js` forwards shortcuts the menu already claims

This looks redundant, and on Linux it is: GTK consumes an accelerator before the webview sees the key, so the page never
gets a keydown for anything the menu claims and the two paths cannot double-fire. Leave it anyway — Windows is the other
way round, and this table is the only thing running there.

The corollary matters when adding items: any *new* menu accelerator takes that key away from the page. Ctrl+F stays in
`chat.js` precisely because no menu item claims it.

### Ctrl+F expands Chat's collapsed search first, on a wall-clock budget

Chat collapses search to a button and leaves the input in the DOM behind it, invisible — so looking the input up
directly fails in exactly the state the key is pressed in. Expanding means clicking Chat's own button, and then waiting:
the box takes around 300 ms to draw on a software-rendered desktop, and Chat closes it again if nothing inside gains
focus. A retry budget counted in animation frames runs out first, which is why the budget is wall-clock. A frame is not
a unit of time.

The button is identified as the visible one inside the `[role="search"]` landmark rather than by `aria-label`, which is
English here and something else wherever the app is used in another language.

### Zoom is stored at once and handed to the webview a moment later

`set_zoom` looks like it should just call `window.set_zoom`. Doing that synchronously let a page hold the main thread
for four minutes with 200 calls through `menu_action`, because applying a level is a full relayout of Chat's page and
the page can ask for any number of them (Notes.md has the figures). So the level is stored immediately and delivered by
`apply_soon` once the requests stop, which makes a burst of any size cost one relayout at the level it ended on.

It applies on the *leading* edge — the first press after a quiet spell goes straight through — because a pure trailing
debounce made a single Ctrl+= feel sluggish. Only a press arriving inside the settle window waits. There is one delivery
thread at a time rather than one per request, and `set_zoom` from off the main thread reaches the event loop the same
way `features::connectivity` reaches `navigate`.

A rate limit was the obvious alternative and would have done nothing: the calls were already 1.2 s apart, each waiting
on the relayout it had just asked for.

### The config file is written at most once a second

Two guards, because they catch different things. A change that serialises to what is already on disk writes nothing —
which alone took a 200-call zoom loop from 201 writes to about 20. On top of that the file is written at most once
every `WRITE_EVERY`, with a burst held in memory and one writer scheduled to carry whatever it settles on.

The throttle leaves a window where a change is only in memory. Both quit paths call `config::flush`, so that window is
really only open for a crash or a `kill -9`, and the settings it covers are cheap to redo.

### Edit → Undo and Redo are custom items driving `document.execCommand`

muda's predefined Undo and Redo are documented Unsupported on Linux, so asking for them adds nothing and the Edit menu
opens with Cut.

They deliberately carry no accelerator. Claiming Ctrl+Z would take the webview's own working undo away and route it
through `execCommand`, which cannot reach an editable inside a cross-origin frame — a clear downgrade.

### Fullscreen is asked for on macOS only

muda draws the item on Windows and it does nothing when clicked, which is worse than not offering it. Linux renders
nothing at all.

### `app_menu::nested_check_item` walks the submenus by hand

`Menu::get` searches the top level only, so every check item under Preferences is invisible to it. Rebuilding the whole
menu with `set_menu` does get every tick right, but GTK answers it with one *"no accelerator installed in accel group"*
warning per accelerator, every time. Walking by hand avoids both. This is also why the Preferences toggles keep their
own state rather than reading a tick back — the link grant is the one setting that changes without a click, so it is the
one that needs to clear its own tick.

## Windows, restart and reset

### `window::show_and_focus` hides a minimised window before showing it

Cinnamon will not deiconify: `unminimize()` reaches `gtk_window_deiconify` and the window stays iconic however often it
is asked. Hiding and showing re-maps it in the normal state. Focus is then asked for a second time, because tao refuses
to focus a window it still believes is minimised and only learns otherwise when the window manager confirms — which is
after the first call has returned.

### …and does not do the same for a visible, unfocused window on Wayland

Tempting, since the hide-then-show demonstrably gets focus today. Don't. It works only because compositors still treat a
newly mapped window leniently, and that leniency is exactly what they are tightening. It would also cost real behaviour
meanwhile: hiding a *visible* window makes Chat's page inert and flashes the user. The gap — tray → Toggle on a visible,
unfocused window produces GNOME's "window is ready" notification instead of a raise — is a documented limitation waiting
on xdg-activation support in tao, not an oversight.

### `features::reset` deletes at the top of the *next* launch

WebKit's storage cannot be deleted from under a live webview: `clear_all_browsing_data` is asynchronous, and the network
process writes the cookie jar out again as it shuts down, so a reset-then-restart leaves the user still signed in. The
reset drops a sentinel and does the deleting before any plugin or webview has opened those files.

### `request_restart` exits through `RunEvent::Exit`, not `AppHandle::restart`

`AppHandle::restart` spawns the replacement *before* plugin shutdown, so the new process finds the single-instance name
still held, hands its argv to the process on its way out, and exits — leaving nothing running at all. It also never
returns, which deadlocks a caller on a plugin thread. The replacement path needs the same `quitting` flag as Quit and
close-to-tray, or the window-close veto cancels it.

## Offline and sign-in

### `chat.js` rewrites the webview's failed-load page

WebKitGTK builds that page as `<html><body>%s</body></html>` — the whole template — so the one line explaining the
failure renders as black text on the window's dark grey background. wry exposes no `did-fail-load` equivalent for Rust
to hang a replacement on, so the page-side script does it.

The fingerprint it matches — empty head, a body with text and no elements — is narrow on purpose: WKWebView leaves the
document empty and WebView2 draws its own styled page, so neither is touched.

### **Try again** is a `<button>` aimed at Chat's canonical trailing-slash URL

Two constraints, both from the same page. Its origin is opaque, so `isCrossOrigin` calls every link on it external and
the interceptor silently swallows an ordinary anchor — a `<button>` with a handler sidesteps that. And WebKit refuses to
navigate the stand-in document to the URL it is standing in for, while any *differently spelled* URL navigates
immediately; Google answers `/chat/u/0` with a 302 to `/chat/u/0/`, so the trailing slash is a spelling that works.

### `features::connectivity` keeps polling after it has reported offline

The error page cannot retry itself, so without the poller, joining wifi after an offline launch leaves the app stuck on
that page for as long as it stays open. It only ever starts when the app launched with no network at all and stops on
the first success, so the cost is one TCP connect twice a minute for exactly as long as there is nothing to connect to.

### `features::sign_in` sends its redirect from a spawned thread

`navigate` from inside `on_page_load` re-enters the webview: `send_user_message` dispatches inline when it is already on
the main thread, and `on_page_load` *is* the main thread, inside WebKit's own `load-changed` handler.
`run_on_main_thread` is no escape — it goes through the same function. A spawned thread routes the navigation through
the event loop, which runs it once the load has settled.

### …and redirects at most twice in a row

A sign-out can land on a Google advertisement that **History → Go to Chat** only bounces off, so the redirect to
`accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin` is worth having. But a redirect loop would be worse than the dead end, and the dead
end is clickable now anyway, so the guard gives up and warns.

## Updates

### `features::updates` asks `/releases`, skips drafts, and takes the highest version

Not `/releases/latest`, which 404s for a repository that has only ever pre-released — indistinguishable from having
never released anything. And not the first entry either: GitHub orders `/releases` by creation date, so a patch to an
older line can be published after, and appear ahead of, a newer release.

### The HTTP client names its TLS provider explicitly

ureq defaults to Rustls and, if that is not the compiled feature, neither falls back nor errors — it *panics, mid
request*. `native-tls` is the feature here, so TLS comes from the platform: OpenSSL on Linux, which WebKitGTK already
pulls in, Schannel on Windows, Security.framework on macOS.

### Nothing is downloaded or installed

Tauri's own updater plugin signs an artifact and swaps it in, which needs a signing key in CI and on Linux only ever
works for an AppImage, never the deb most people install. This app opens the release page in the browser instead.
`uploadUpdaterJson` is off in `release.yml` for the same reason.

### `tauri-plugin-log` gets both targets in one `targets()` call

It starts with a stdout target *and* a log-directory target already. Adding them with `target()` leaves the defaults in
place and writes every line twice.

## Tray

### The tray-icon dependency exists only for its `ksni` feature

Click events: libappindicator delivers none, ksni does. Cargo can only turn features on, so a direct dependency is the
only way to enable it; the app never calls tray-icon.

### The tray's About is a regular item on Linux

The ksni menu snapshot renders predefined items (except separators) as disabled blanks, so About is an ordinary
`MenuItem` opening a message dialog. macOS and Windows keep the predefined item.

### A missing tray is not fatal, and closing then minimises

ksni registers with a StatusNotifierWatcher on the session bus and fails outright when there is none — vanilla GNOME
without the AppIndicator extension, XEmbed-only panels, or an autostart that beats the panel to the bus. tray-icon gives
no way to ask ksni to wait for one. Without the `match` in `setup` the app would not start at all. With no tray,
`close_to_tray::hide` minimises instead of hiding and `--hidden` is ignored, since a hidden window with no tray has no
way back.

## Deliberately not built

Auto-update that installs itself, and a spellchecker toggle, for which Tauri exposes no API.

Attachment links open in the system browser, which works. `on_download` would keep them in-app: one line in
`urls::is_in_app`.
